## Usage
Run the following command to install the dependencies for the project:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, simply run for single GPU or CPU training:
```
python main.py
```

## Datasets

We used two datasets; ImageNet and Cifar10.

The datasets are available from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kIlQXoOl7tl8GwX-PKvvZR-Aklm16F59?usp=share_link

### Steps to get and use the dataset
1. Create a folder named "dataset" in the project root folder
2. Download and extract the dataset(s) and then move them to the newly created directory.
3. Ensure you rename the ImageNet folder to "imagenet" and the Cifar10 folder to "cifar10v2"

You also need to create a folder named "save" in the project root folder where the checkpoints and other code generated files would be saved in.

Ask Prof. Crick if we need to pay for registration
